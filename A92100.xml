            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

take his leave of his royall Uncle, the King of England, and to come to the Hague in Holland,
whereby ≈øhe might impart her minde unto him: he being willing to fulfil his Mothers de≈øires,
and ≈øorry for his fir≈øt coming over, declared his re≈øolution to His Maje≈øty, that hee was
now re≈øolved to leave England, de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring His Maje≈øty not to be di≈øplea≈øed thereat; and
that according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt of his power, he would endeavour to ≈øend over ≈øuch able

            <p>His Excellency the Earle of E≈ø≈øer having left a ≈øtrong gari≈øon at Worce≈øter and all
other places which he thought might prove prejudiciall to his Army, if that the malignant Party
≈øhould take them into their po≈ø≈øe≈øsion, and having ≈øecvred the≈øe places, hee, advanced

vehement, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch as his Excellency could not march with his whole army fa≈øt enough towards
Shrewsbury, therefore hee ≈øent Colonell Hollis, Colonell Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and divers other Officers with
three thou≈øand hor≈øe and Foot before, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the information which he had newly
received, that ≈øome of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces that lay neere unto the ≈øaid towne of Shrewsbury
were in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe the Kings Army were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt gathered to a head, and lay
within five miles of the ≈øaid towne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expected they ≈øhould ≈øuddenly have a
battell with them, and not being able to encounter with them, becau≈øe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers did far
exceed them in number, therefore forth with they di≈øpatched Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Lord Generall,
de≈øiring ≈øpeedy aid from his Excellency, and according
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117704:4"/>to their de≈øires, he ≈øent the aforenamed
Eosses, which no ≈øooner arrived there, but immediately they had a battell with the Cavaliers,
being in number about ≈øeven thou≈øand Hor≈øe and Foer, which were under the command of the
Earle of Lind≈øey, and the Earle of We≈øtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and our Forces were not above four thou≈øand

of three houres, the enemy retreated with the lo≈ø≈øe of fifty men, and twenty three on our

            <p>From Bridgnorth there is informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by divers letters that the Lord Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby of Parham hath
joyned his Forces with his Excellency the Earle of E≈ø≈øex, and are in their march towards
Shrewsbury, and by the way they found great oppo≈øition at Bridgnorth (which is a towne about

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117704:4"/>whereupon there ≈øoone increa≈øed many dangers,
and the inveterate malice of the Cavaliers there bur≈øt out, and began to give out many ≈øcoffing

leave of their Officers to di≈øcharge again≈øt them; but at the fir≈øt they ≈øeemed ≈øomwhat
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and would not conde≈øcend thereunto, untill they under≈øtood the plea≈øure of the
Lord Generall; but after ≈øome con≈øultation thereof, they ≈øell to it pell mell, and in the
≈øpace of five hours ≈øeventy of the Cavaliers were ≈ølaine, and divers taken pri≈øoners, with
very little lo≈ø≈øe on our party: wherupon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ≈øounded a parley, and at the ≈øaid
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley it was concluded on, that a ≈øet day ≈øhould be appointed for the meeting of both
